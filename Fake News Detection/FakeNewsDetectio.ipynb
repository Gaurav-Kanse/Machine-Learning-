Just days after Webb s announcement, his career may already be over due to a careless screenshot that he took and posted to his campaign s Facebook. That s because Webb accidentally left a couple of porn sites open in his browser which can be seen in the image he shared.Here s the screenshot that Webb shared:Here s a closer look at the screenshot:The story gets even more hilarious, considering that Webb was already involved in another controversy. Webb had failed to file his FEC report on time, which he claims that he could not do because of a virus that had infected his computer.The post has been up for 11 hours at the time of this writing. Since Webb posted the screenshot, he has made two more posts to his Facebook page. In the first one, he writes a very long letter of condemnation towards those mocking him. He begins the post by writing,  SEE HOW DIRTY YOU ARE? In the post, Webb writes after that one is far more bizarre. He begins the post by saying  THANKS FOR THE TAB CHECK, RANGER BUDDIES!  This is followed by a Bible verse: For the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.  Psalm 100:5The post is accompanied with a screenshot that shows his page s reach. That s because he is proud of the negative attention he has received. Webb goes on to write that the  the Lord  has lifted him up. Apparently, in Webb s mind Jesus has the same mentality as a public relations agent who holds true to the theory that no publicity is bad publicity.Featured image from screenshot via Mike Webb s campaign site\",\n          \"LONDON (Reuters) - Brexit minister David Davis said on Tuesday he believed Britain would agree some kind of basic deal with the European Union, even in the  very improbable  eventuality that they fail to agree a trade deal. Davis told a parliamentary committee that even if Britain failed to strike a formal trade deal both sides were likely to have agreements in areas such as aviation that would allow planes to fly between Britain and the EU. It is  not impossible, but very, very improbable  that Britain and the EU will fail to agree a Brexit deal, Davis told the lawmakers.  Whatever happens we will have a basic deal without the bits we really want,  he said.  \",\n          \"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU and U.S. negotiators said on Friday that they still needed to overcome large differences for a transatlantic free trade deal to be sealed this year, and factor in the impending exit from the European Union of Britain, one of the United States\\u2019 biggest export markets. The two sides are trying to agree on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which supporters say could boost each economy by some $100 billion at a time when growth in China and emerging markets is slowing. Chief EU negotiator Ignacio Garcia Bercero and U.S. counterpart Dan Mullaney told a news conference after a 14th round of talks that both sides were committed to sealing a deal before U.S. President Barack Obama leaves office at the turn of the year. The partners have made progress on tariff elimination and on regulatory cooperation. However, they are stuck over EU demands including greater access to public sector tenders; Garcia Bercero described the U.S. offer as a serious cause of concern. Likewise, Washington is unhappy with the EU offer on services.  \\u201cGiven the importance of this sector to both of our economies ... progress here has been noticeably and painfully slow,\\u201d said Mullaney. He also said that, while the economic rationale for TTIP remained strong, Britain\\u2019s exit from the European Union would force a rethink as it was the largest market anywhere for U.S. services, and took 25 percent of U.S. exports to the EU. \\u201cImagine if the United States said, for instance, \\u2018Well, maybe TTIP will not apply to California\\u2019. There is a certain reflection that the parties need to have on those kind of developments.\\u201d The two sides had previously planned to produce a single consolidated TTIP text by the end of July. Garcia Bercero said that was now more likely to come by the end of September after further meetings between U.S. trade chief Michael Froman and EU commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom. Garcia Bercero acknowledged that the political environment was becoming more challenging. The environmental group Greenpeace echoed the view of many anti-TTIP campaigners on Friday by saying that it was time to hit the \\u2018Stop\\u2019 button. But the EU negotiator said TTIP was instead a positive response to concerns about globalization. \\u201cIf we want to have a shot at shaping globalization, we need a like-minded partner that shares largely our views,\\u201d he said. Mullaney talked of a \\u201cunique window of opportunity\\u201d to complete TTIP this year that should not be allowed to slip away. \\u201cAfter this year, with one political transition after another over the next few years, it could be quite a while before we pick up negotiations again.\\u201d \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"News\",\n          \"US_News\",\n          \"politics\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2397,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"October 5, 2017 \",\n          \"March 10, 2016\",\n          \"January 31, 2016\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
