American taxpayers DO NOT want to pay for this!Trump has stated in the past that he would like to renegotiate the deal but we think he needs to get out of it.

The Paris deal isn t just any other deal. It is a key agreement that shapes today s globalization,  Merkel said, describing discussions with Trump about climate change  very unsatisfying. Merkel doesn t understand that globalization is exactly why we don t like this boondoggle!For opponents of the agreement, the decision is a welcome development after the president s economic adviser, Gary Cohn, told reporters that Trump was  evolving  on the issue.

Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a Democrat who has fought to overhaul the system for three years, introduced the legislation as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, a must-pass annual bill that sets policy for the Pentagon. The measure failed to pass the Senate in March 2014, though Gillibrand, who sits on the armed services committee, said those votes were cast amid \\u201cfalse and misleading information\\u201d the Pentagon used to bolster its own argument. \\u201cWe know far more now about the extent of the military sexual assault problem than we did a year ago, and it\\u2019s clear that nothing has changed,\\u201d Gillibrand said at a news conference alongside both Democratic and Republican senators. The current system requires military commanders to handle sexual assault cases within the ranks. Supporters of the bill say the system is flawed because commanders can be unwilling to prosecute such cases and victims, fearing retaliation, are often afraid to report them.  Top military leaders at the Pentagon contend that prosecutions must remain with commanders to maintain good order and discipline. \\u201cNobody should be forced to go to their boss to report a rape,\\u201d Republican Senator Rand Paul said. The bill failed by 55-45 in 2014. Gillibrand said she has attempted to contact every senator who previously voted against the bill and is \\u201cvery hopeful\\u201d the measure will this time gain the 60 votes needed to advance in the Senate. \\u201cI think many senators that we\\u2019ve spoken to are concerned, deeply concerned,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThe military continues to say, \\u2018We got this,\\u2019 ... but it\\u2019s not shown in the data. It\\u2019s not shown in the survivors\\u2019 testimony.\\u201d She said the bill has not gotten support from Republican Senator John McCain, the chairman of the armed services committee, though she has spoken to him several times about the issue. Samantha Jackson, who said she was raped by her husband when he was in the Army, said the military told the U.S. attorney\\u2019s office they would investigate, only to drop her case without pursuing charges. Jackson called her treatment \\u201ca profound betrayal,\\u201d adding, \\u201cI don\\u2019t understand how the Army could fail to hold my rapist accountable.\\u201d \",\n          \"The main stream media is totally ignoring the horrific case of a Sudanese immigrant who stormed into a Tennessee church this morning and killed 1, injured several. Nashville Police have identified the suspect of a mass shooting at a church Sunday morning as 25-year-old Emanuel Kidega Samson.Samson is being charged with murder and multiple counts of attempted murder in the attack that killed one and left at least seven other people injured at the Burnette Chapel Church of Christ in Antioch, a town just south of Nashville, Tenn.IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE: One brave church member, 22-year-old Caleb Engle, confronted the Samson before being pistol whipped in the face. Engle then went to his car to retrieve a gun, which he has under a concealed carry license (CCL). Engle returned to the church to confront the gunman again. The gunman shot himself in the face when the man returned, possibly by accident. He s the hero here,  Nashville police chief Steve Anderson said.  He s the person who stopped this madness in its tracks. Later today, Engle released a statement: Samson is a bodybuilder who attended high school in Tennessee and is originally from Karthoum, Sudan, according screenshots of the suspect s Facebook page. Emanuel K. Samson came from Sudan in 1996. He was a legal US resident but not necessarily a US citizen.A Nashville Police Department spokesman said the shooter entered the church after 11 a.m. CST wearing a neoprene ski mask. One woman was shot in the parking lot before the shooter entered the church and opened fire on about 42 people still inside.That s when Caleb Engle became the hero that he is It could have been so much worse!SAMSON S BOOKING PHOTO:This is Emanuel Kidega Samson s booking photo. pic.twitter.com/z0Or6rJFAK  Metro Nashville PD (@MNPDNashville) September 25, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Government News\",\n          \"worldnews\",\n          \"News\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2397,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"November 28, 2016\",\n          \"Sep 24, 2015\",\n          \"Jan 8, 2017\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
